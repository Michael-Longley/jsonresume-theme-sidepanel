A resume template built for JSON Resume.

This template consists of a large "bar" on the left side containing some basic
information and a main section which contains education, experience and a
statement.

Feel free to add issues with ways you feel it can be enhanced.

This was done rushed as I needed to begin applying so some of the handlebars and
CSS code can certainly be cleaned up. I hope to work on this after finishing
applying.
